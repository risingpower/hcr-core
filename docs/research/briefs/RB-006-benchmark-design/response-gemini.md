# **RB-006: Benchmark Design for Hierarchical Coarse-to-Fine Retrieval**

## **Architectural Validation Context and Strategic Directives**

The transition of the Hierarchical Coarse-to-Fine Retrieval (HCR) architecture from a theoretical specification to a production-ready engineering phase requires a definitive validation framework. The preceding research phases successfully specified a dual-path retrieval system utilizing bisecting k-means clustering, structured contrastive routing summaries, and a submodular knapsack selection mechanism operating under a strict 400-token budget. The system design relies heavily on cross-branch defenses, specifically entity cross-links and a co-primary collapsed-tree traversal, to navigate the complexities of an organisational knowledge base. The central objective of this benchmark is to rigorously validate or invalidate the three foundational hypotheses underpinning this architecture, thereby defining the absolute success criteria for the Phase 1 go/no-go gate.

The hypotheses under evaluation are: Token Efficiency (H1a), which posits that HCR achieves equivalent or superior answer accuracy to flat retrieval while consuming significantly fewer tokens; Hybrid Superiority (H1b), which theorizes that the dual-path architecture combining coarse elimination with fine similarity outperforms pure single-path paradigms; and Scoring Quality Leverage (H1c), which asserts that per-level routing accuracy (![][image1]) and entity cross-link quality dictate the end-to-end retrieval efficacy, with error compounding geometrically at ![][image2].

Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) benchmarking methodologies are fundamentally misaligned with the requirements of this validation. Standard metrics such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) operate on the assumption of human users sequentially examining ranked lists with diminishing attention.1 In contrast, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems feed context to a Large Language Model (LLM) that processes the entire context window simultaneously. Furthermore, traditional metrics fail to penalize "distracting" but highly ranked irrelevant documents, which actively degrade the LLM's generative accuracy within a constrained token budget.1 Consequently, an entirely bespoke evaluation protocol is required to measure the novel components of HCR, specifically the per-level routing error (![][image1]), the distinctiveness of routing summaries, and the coverage of entity cross-links.

This benchmark design must reconcile the necessity for extreme academic rigor with the practical constraints of a single-researcher Phase 1 environment. It mandates a hybrid corpus engineering strategy, a statistically significant stratified query suite, a novel metric framework adapted from hierarchical classification and multi-entity benchmarks, and a strict "fail-fast" experimental sequencing protocol designed to identify fatal architectural flaws before incurring extensive computational and API costs.

## **Corpus Engineering and the Transition Period Strategy**

Organisational knowledge bases possess topological properties that deviate significantly from standard academic retrieval corpora. Enterprise data is inherently temporal, densely interlinked via entities (personnel, projects, policies, tools), and encompasses a wide spectrum of semantic abstraction, ranging from high-level strategic mandates to granular, version-controlled procedural documentation.2 Evaluating HCR against generalized datasets like BEIR 4 or Massive Text Embedding Benchmarks (MTEB) is insufficient, as these collections primarily consist of information-seeking queries where surface-level semantic matching is adequate, failing to simulate the complex reasoning required in enterprise environments.5

### **Hybrid Corpus Composition**

To definitively validate the HCR architecture, the benchmark corpus must be a carefully engineered hybrid. Relying exclusively on a synthetic corpus risks overfitting the tree construction algorithms to predictable, artificially generated semantic distributions. Conversely, utilizing a purely real-world dataset obscures the measurement of specific architectural failure modes—such as Deep Point Identifier (DPI) information loss or budget impossibility—because the ground truth of the dataset's topological constraints cannot be perfectly known. Therefore, the benchmark mandates a composite corpus constructed from highly specific subsets of existing enterprise-adjacent datasets, augmented with controlled synthetic injections.

The foundational layer of the corpus will be built upon the EnronQA dataset.7 Consisting of over 100,000 emails and corresponding question-answer pairs spanning distinct user inboxes, the Enron corpus provides an authentic representation of the temporal evolution of projects and the dense, chaotic interplay of personnel and entity relationships characteristic of an organisational knowledge base.9 To supplement this unstructured communication data with formal organizational documentation, the corpus will integrate specific industry-aligned subsets from the RAGBench collection.10 Specifically, the cuad subset will provide complex, lengthy legal and policy documents, while the emanual and techqa subsets will supply dense procedural and technical documentation.10

This foundational data will then be subjected to targeted synthetic augmentation. To stress-test the 26 identified failure modes—particularly the vulnerability of strict hierarchical traversal to Deep Point Identifier (DPI) loss—the corpus will feature "Needle-in-a-Haystack" (NIAH) injections.13 These injections will consist of highly specific, temporally versioned policy updates (e.g., "Effective Q3 2025, the maximum allowable expenditure for software procurement is $4,250") and isolated numeric identifiers deliberately embedded across disparate semantic clusters. This deliberate fragmentation ensures that the entity cross-link mechanism is rigorously tested for its ability to bridge distant branches of the tree during query resolution.

### **Scaling Dimensionality and the Transition Period**

Theoretical modeling from preceding research phases indicates that HCR's architectural advantages over strong flat retrieval only manifest at scale, specifically projecting an inflection point at ![][image3] documents. At smaller corpus sizes, the token overhead associated with processing routing summaries and traversing internal nodes may outweigh the compression benefits of the hierarchy, creating a high-risk "transition period" where flat retrieval is superior.14

To validate this critical scaling dynamic, the corpus must be engineered with a growth dimension. The benchmark protocol will execute the complete evaluation suite across three distinct corpus scales:

1. **10,000 Documents (The Baseline Phase):** At this scale, flat retrieval utilizing a cross-encoder reranker is expected to dominate. Executing the benchmark at this volume serves to quantify the baseline overhead of HCR's tree structure and establishes the maximum performance penalty incurred during the early lifecycle of a newly initialized knowledge base.  
2. **50,000 Documents (The Inflection Phase):** This represents the theoretical crossover point. At this scale, the ![][image2] error compounding of the tree traversal must be offset by the precision gains and context-window efficiency generated by coarse-to-fine pruning.  
3. **100,000 Documents (The Validation Phase):** The target operational scale for the Phase 1 benchmark. At this volume, the capacity of the submodular knapsack to maximize relevance and minimize redundancy under a strict 400-token constraint must clearly demonstrate the H1a (Token Efficiency) superiority of HCR over unconstrained flat retrieval.15

## **Query Suite Stratification and Generation Dynamics**

The query distribution within an organisational knowledge base dictates the structural defenses required of the retrieval system. Prior telemetry established an estimated distribution consisting heavily of single-branch thematic queries (\~55–75%), cross-branch and entity-spanning queries (\~20–40%), and detail/identifier queries (\~50–65%). To achieve statistical significance in the evaluation of these distinct modalities, the benchmark requires a highly curated suite of 400 golden queries. Statistical power analyses in LLM-as-a-judge methodologies indicate that sample sizes of 24 to 50 queries per specific sub-stratum yield a ![][image4] statistical power to detect medium-to-large effect sizes (Cohen's ![][image5]) at an ![][image6] significance level.17 A 400-query suite ensures robust confidence intervals across all highly specific query classifications.

### **Query Distribution Matrix**

The query suite must be stratified to deliberately trigger the identified architectural mechanisms and expected failure modes. The distribution is formalized as follows:

| Query Stratification Category | Proportion | Count | Architectural Validation Target | Operational Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Single-Branch Thematic** | 25% | 100 | Routing Summary Efficacy (![][image1]) | Broad conceptual queries requiring deep traversal down a single semantic path. Evaluates the distinctiveness of the contrastive routing summaries. |
| **Entity-Spanning (Cross-Branch)** | 20% | 80 | Entity Cross-Link Quality | Queries requiring the synthesis of an entity's activity across disparate projects or timelines. Tests the primary defense mechanism against lateral fragmentation. |
| **Detail/Identifier (DPI)** | 25% | 100 | Collapsed Tree Co-Primary Path | High-precision queries targeting specific version numbers, dates, or error codes. Designed to evaluate the efficacy of the RAPTOR-style flat search over all nodes. |
| **Multi-Hop / Comparative** | 15% | 60 | Submodular Knapsack Selection | Queries requiring chained reasoning or explicit comparison between two distinct policies. Evaluates the AdaGReS algorithm's ability to balance relevance and diversity within the token budget. |
| **Budget-Impossible / Aggregation** | 10% | 40 | Fail-Fast Detection Accuracy | Exhaustive listing queries that physically cannot be answered within 400 tokens. Evaluates the system's ability to trigger an early halt condition prior to generative execution. |
| **Out-of-Distribution (OOD)** | 5% | 20 | Hallucination Resistance | Queries completely unrelated to the corpus domain, measuring the system's propensity for empty-set retrieval accuracy. |

### **Generation Methodologies and Ground Truth Formulation**

Due to the constraints of a single-researcher Phase 1 environment, manual generation of 400 highly complex queries is operationally unfeasible. The suite will be primarily generated utilizing LLM-driven synthesis frameworks, specifically adapting the AutoQ component of the BenchmarkQED suite.18 AutoQ synthesizes queries across a highly controlled local-to-global spectrum, allowing for the automated generation of both highly localized DPI queries and broad, global thematic queries.18

For the critical Entity-Spanning subset, the prompt architecture will be adapted from the MEBench framework, which specializes in generating multi-document, multi-entity questions that require the integration of scattered information—perfectly simulating the cross-branch routing challenge.19

Crucially, the concept of "Ground Truth" must be adapted for token-constrained retrieval. Traditional benchmarks define ground truth purely by identifying relevant document IDs. For HCR, every synthesized query must be subjected to a final manual validation pass to append two vital metadata fields: a Boolean "Budget Feasibility" label (establishing whether the query can theoretically be answered within 400 tokens) and an explicit "Golden Evidence Set." The Golden Evidence Set defines the absolute minimum required context passages necessary to satisfy the query. This decoupling of the required evidence from the final generated text allows for the independent evaluation of the retrieval cascade and the generative LLM phase, a critical requirement for diagnosing whether failures stem from routing errors or context utilization errors.22

## **Rigorous Metric Formulations for Constrained Retrieval**

The measurement of HCR's efficacy necessitates the formulation of metrics that depart from conventional IR paradigms. If HCR is to be validated as a superior architecture, it must be evaluated on its ability to minimize routing errors, maximize token efficiency, and construct a highly distinguishable tree topology. The following metrics are explicitly designed to operationalize and test H1a, H1b, and H1c.

### **Per-Level Routing Accuracy (![][image1]) \- Validating H1c**

Hypothesis 1c asserts that end-to-end retrieval quality is primarily governed by the per-level routing error ![][image1], which compounds at ![][image2]. To date, no hierarchical retrieval system has empirically measured this per-level accuracy, rendering the compounding equation a purely theoretical construct. The complexity in measuring ![][image1] arises from HCR's soft assignment mechanism; because documents may be mapped to 1-3 parent nodes, binary accuracy metrics are insufficient to capture partial routing successes.23

To quantify ![][image1], we adapt the Hierarchical Precision (![][image7]) formulation established in hierarchical classification literature.23 For a given query ![][image8], let ![][image9] represent the ground-truth set of optimal branches at a specific depth ![][image10], and let ![][image11] represent the set of branches actively selected by the HCR routing cascade (the BM25+Dense pre-filter leading to the Cross-Encoder reranker).

Hierarchical Precision is defined as the intersection of the correctly selected branches over the total number of selected branches:

![][image12]  
The per-level routing error ![][image1] for a given depth ![][image10] across the entire query set ![][image13] is therefore defined as the aggregate complement of the hierarchical precision:

![][image14]  
Establishing the ground-truth optimal branches (![][image9]) without exhaustive manual annotation of the entire tree requires a programmatic approach. The benchmark will execute an offline, "bottom-up" Oracle mapping run prior to standard testing. By taking the Golden Evidence Set chunks for a query and tracing their assigned parent nodes upward through the hierarchy to the root, the benchmark deterministically defines the optimal traversal paths. The empirical measurement of ![][image15] during live testing will subsequently allow the plotting of actual compounding error against the theoretical ![][image2] prediction, providing the definitive validation of H1c.

### **Token Efficiency Curve (AUTAC) \- Validating H1a**

Hypothesis 1a posits that HCR achieves equivalent or superior answer accuracy to flat retrieval while consuming significantly fewer tokens. Traditional metrics like Recall@k fail to capture the economic and computational cost of expanding the context window.1 To measure this, we introduce the Area Under the Token-Accuracy Curve (AUTAC) methodology.

Retrieval accuracy is measured not as a static value, but as a function of the token budget ![][image16]. For each query, the retrieval system is constrained to return a maximum of ![][image16] tokens, iterating through budgets ![][image17]. The retrieved context at each threshold is passed to a fixed evaluator LLM (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). The resulting generation is then scored for Answer Correctness and Faithfulness utilizing the Ragas evaluation framework, which utilizes an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm demonstrated to have high correlation with human judgment.22

A successful validation of H1a requires the resulting performance curve of HCR to exhibit a steep initial gradient, plateauing near its maximum achievable accuracy at or below the ![][image18] target. In contrast, flat retrieval is expected to demonstrate a shallower gradient, requiring significantly higher token budgets to reach parity. The specific success threshold dictates that HCR's Answer Correctness at ![][image18] must be greater than or equal to the flat baseline's accuracy at ![][image19].

### **Entity Cross-Link Quality (EA-F1) \- Co-Validating H1c**

Given that up to 55% of the anticipated enterprise workload is entity-centric, the efficacy of the entity cross-link mechanism is a co-primary determinant of success alongside routing accuracy. To measure this, the benchmark utilizes the Entity-Attributed F1 (EA-F1) metric, derived from the MEBench cross-document evaluation framework.19

EA-F1 evaluates whether the retrieved context contains the necessary and sufficient entity footprints to permit multi-hop reasoning across disparate documents. The benchmark extracts the exact set of named entities present within the query's Golden Evidence Set (![][image20]) and compares it against the entities present within the final retrieved context under the token constraint (![][image21]). By calculating the harmonic mean of entity coverage (Recall) and context dilution (Precision), EA-F1 ensures that the submodular knapsack is successfully utilizing cross-links to bridge distant branches without exhausting the 400-token budget on irrelevant, highly-connected entities.

### **Tree Quality Diagnostics: Sibling Distinctiveness (SD)**

A significant research gap identified during the theoretical design phase was the absence of routing-specific tree quality metrics. If the internal nodes of the tree are semantically homogenous, the cross-encoder cascade will be mathematically incapable of making confident routing decisions, leading to high ![][image1] values. To pre-diagnose the viability of the generated hierarchy, we adapt the Sibling Distinctiveness (SD) metric.28

For any parent node ![][image22] with child nodes ![][image23] (where ![][image24] is the tree's branching factor), SD is calculated as the average cosine distance between the dense embeddings of the contrastive routing summaries of all sibling pairs. High SD indicates that the bisecting k-means clustering successfully partitioned the semantic space into highly discriminable categories, facilitating efficient coarse-to-fine pruning.

![][image25]  
where ![][image26] represents the dense embedding vector of a node's summary. By calculating the average SD across all parent nodes in the tree, the benchmark establishes a critical, pre-retrieval diagnostic indicator of tree health.

### **Dual-Path Superiority and Budget Detection**

The remaining operational hypotheses require specific telemetry instrumentation. To validate H1b (Hybrid Superiority), the benchmark must record not only the final Answer Correctness, but the "Path Win Rate." Because beam search and collapsed-tree retrieval are executed in parallel, the system must log which path generated the context ultimately selected by the path-relevance Exponential Moving Average (EMA) confidence score. By mapping the Path Win Rate against the Query Stratification categories, the benchmark validates the theoretical assertion that Collapsed Tree dominates on specific DPI queries while Beam Search dominates on thematic traversals.

Finally, the Budget-Impossible detection mechanism requires standard binary classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score). For the 10% of queries designed to be exhaustive aggregations (e.g., "List every employee involved in Project X"), the metric evaluates the system's ability to output a discrete "Status: Unanswerable due to budget constraints" token, averting the execution of the generative LLM and fulfilling the fail-fast operational requirement.30

## **Baseline Architecture Selection and Comparative Analysis**

Definitive validation of HCR requires benchmarking against architectural approaches representing both the industry standard and the state-of-the-art academic alternatives. The selection of baselines must balance rigorous comparative analysis with the implementation constraints of a single-researcher Phase 1 team.

### **Primary Baselines**

1. **Strong Flat Baseline (BM25 \+ Dense ![][image27] Cross-Encoder):** This represents the current optimal "do nothing fancy" industry standard. Documents are segmented into fixed-length chunks and stored linearly within a vector database. Retrieval utilizes a hybrid search pre-filter (combining BM25 lexical scoring with a dense embedding model like BGE-M3) to retrieve the top 100 chunks, followed by a dedicated cross-encoder (e.g., MiniLM) to rerank the chunks before applying the 400-token cutoff.15 This baseline is critical; it isolates the exact value of the hierarchical tree. If HCR cannot definitively outperform this baseline under constrained budgets, the computational overhead of constructing and maintaining the tree is unjustified.  
2. **RAPTOR (Collapsed Tree Fallback):** Representing the closest prior art in hierarchical retrieval, RAPTOR utilizes recursive clustering combined with generic, non-contrastive summarization.32 The benchmark will implement RAPTOR's specific collapsed-tree retrieval mechanism, which flattens the hierarchy and searches all nodes simultaneously using standard cosine similarity.33 By comparing HCR's structured {theme, includes, excludes} contrastive summaries and dual-path routing cascade against RAPTOR, the benchmark isolates the impact of HCR's specific algorithmic innovations.  
3. **Naive Top-k Dense:** A foundational baseline utilizing a high-performance embedding model (e.g., OpenAI text-embedding-3-small) with no secondary reranking, lexical filtering, or hierarchy. This serves primarily as a sanity check to ensure the underlying embeddings are generating coherent topological clusters and provides a baseline for the absolute minimum operational latency.

### **The Exclusion of LATTICE**

While the LATTICE framework—which utilizes Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to generate semantic concept lattices—represents a strong theoretical competitor 34, constructing mathematically rigorous concept lattices over a 100,000-document enterprise corpus is highly complex and computationally prohibitive. Given the constraints of the Phase 1 team, LATTICE is excluded from the primary go/no-go baseline suite, though it remains a candidate for comparative analysis in Phase 2 scaling operations.

## **Operational Protocol and Fail-Fast Experimental Sequencing**

To ensure reproducibility, mitigate the inherent stochasticity of LLM evaluations, and strictly manage API expenditure, the benchmark execution relies on a rigidly defined experimental protocol and a "fail-fast" sequencing strategy. The evaluation utilizes a deterministic Train/Dev/Test split for the 400-query suite. Tree hyperparameters (such as beam width ![][image28] and tree depth ![][image29]) will be tuned exclusively on the Dev set (80 queries), while final validation metrics are drawn purely from the held-out Test set (320 queries) to prevent structural overfitting to the evaluation data.

### **LLM Variability Control**

LLM-as-a-judge frameworks are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing and exhibit inherent probabilistic variance.36 To control for this, all generative and evaluative LLM calls will enforce a strict temperature setting of ![][image30]. Furthermore, for critical metrics such as Answer Correctness and Faithfulness, the protocol implements a self-consistency check: the evaluator LLM will process each query three separate times, utilizing a majority-vote consensus to determine the final Boolean or scalar score. This ensures that measured variances are attributable to the underlying retrieval architecture rather than the evaluator's stochasticity.

### **The Fail-Fast Experimental Sequence**

The experiments are ordered strictly by dependency and implementation cost. If a foundational experiment fails to meet its predefined success criteria, the Phase 1 build is immediately paused or halted, preventing the waste of computational resources on expensive downstream generative evaluations.

**Experiment 1: Tree Topology Diagnostics (Zero LLM API Evaluation Cost)**

* **Action:** Construct the tree at the 10K corpus scale. Calculate the Average Sibling Distinctiveness (SD) across all internal nodes.  
* **Hypothesis Tested:** Foundation of H1c (Summaries are semantically distinguishable).  
* **Kill Criterion:** If ![][image31], the summaries are highly overlapping, indicating that the clustering parameters or the contrastive prompting mechanism is fatally flawed. The architecture requires reworking before proceeding to retrieval tests.

**Experiment 2: Per-Level Routing Accuracy Validation (Low Cost)**

* **Action:** Execute the scoring cascade on the Dev query set against the 50K corpus. Compare the chosen traversal paths to the offline Oracle ground truth to calculate ![][image15].  
* **Hypothesis Tested:** H1c (Error compounding is minimized).  
* **Kill Criterion:** If ![][image32] (root-level error exceeds 5%), the tree traversal is fundamentally broken, as error compounding will irrevocably destroy end-to-end recall at the leaf nodes. The project is halted until the BM25+Dense pre-filter is recalibrated.

**Experiment 3: The Token Efficiency Race (Medium Cost)**

* **Action:** Execute HCR and the Strong Flat Baseline across the Test query set at incremental token budgets ![][image33]. Score using the Ragas LLM-as-a-judge framework for Answer Correctness.22  
* **Hypothesis Tested:** H1a (Token efficiency under strict bounds).  
* **Kill Criterion:** If HCR produces an Answer Correctness score at ![][image18] that is lower than the Flat Baseline at ![][image18], the submodular knapsack and hierarchical summaries are failing to compress the semantic space effectively.

**Experiment 4: Hybrid Superiority and Cross-Link Efficacy (High Cost)**

* **Action:** Analyze the Path Win Rate telemetry from Experiment 3\. Execute targeted ablations on the Entity-Spanning query subset to isolate the impact of the entity cross-links.  
* **Hypothesis Tested:** H1b (Dual-path superiority) and H1c (Entity leverage).

## **Minimum Viable Ablation Strategy**

To fully understand component contributions without triggering a combinatorial explosion of test runs, the Phase 1 Minimum Viable Ablation (MVA) set restricts testing to the four highest-leverage architectural components.

| Ablation Variable | Operational Change | Primary Metric Monitored | Hypothesis Validated |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Summary Structure** | Replace HCR contrastive summaries with generic RAPTOR-style summaries. | ![][image15], Sibling Distinctiveness | H1c: Validates the necessity of contrastive {includes, excludes} formatting for accurate routing. |
| **Dual-Path Disabling** | Force execution of pure Beam Search, then pure Collapsed Tree. | Answer Correctness, Path Win Rate | H1b: Proves that hybrid integration outperforms either pure approach across varied query types. |
| **Cross-Links Disabled** | Remove entity pointer jumps between discrete branches. | EA-F1 on Entity-Spanning queries | H1c: Confirms entity cross-links as the primary defense mechanism against lateral fragmentation. |
| **Strict Hierarchy** | Restrict document mapping to a single parent node (![][image34] assignment). | ![][image15], Recall@k | General: Proves the fragility of strict elimination and the necessity of multi-parent soft assignment. |

Hyperparameters such as beam width ($k \\in $) and tree depth (![][image35]) will be tuned heuristically during the Dev phase and frozen for the Test phase, deferring exhaustive parametric sweeps to Phase 2\.

## **Quantitative Success Criteria and Go/No-Go Thresholds**

The benchmark yields actionable intelligence through strictly defined quantitative thresholds. The go/no-go decision for advancing HCR into full-scale production implementation hinges entirely on the system meeting or exceeding the following metrics on the 100K document corpus.

**H1a (Token Efficiency) Gate:**

* **Success Threshold:** The HCR Answer Correctness score at a budget of ![][image18] tokens must be greater than or equal to the Strong Flat Baseline's Answer Correctness score at a budget of ![][image19] tokens.  
* **Meaningful Delta:** HCR must demonstrate a sustained ![][image36] relative improvement in Answer Correctness at the 400-token constraint compared directly to flat retrieval at the same budget.  
* **Kill Criterion:** Failure to match or exceed flat retrieval at equivalent token budgets definitively invalidates the economic and operational value of the architecture.

**H1b (Hybrid Superiority) Gate:**

* **Success Threshold:** The Dual-Path system must demonstrate a ![][image37] absolute improvement in end-to-end Answer Correctness over the best-performing isolated single path (pure beam search or pure collapsed tree).  
* **Diagnostic Validation:** The telemetry for Path Win Rate must reflect the theoretical design: the Collapsed Tree path must win ![][image38] of Detail/Identifier (DPI) queries, while the Beam Search path must win ![][image39] of Single-Branch Thematic queries.

**H1c (Scoring Lever and Entity Cross-links) Gate:**

* **Success Threshold:** The per-level routing error (![][image1]) must be empirically measured at ![][image40] (a 2.5% error rate) at depths ![][image41] and ![][image42].  
* **Success Threshold:** The Entity-Attributed F1 (EA-F1) score on the Entity-Spanning query subset must exceed the EA-F1 of the Strong Flat Baseline by ![][image43].  
* **Kill Criterion:** An empirical measurement of ![][image44] at the root level indicates that the foundational routing mechanism is fundamentally unstable, causing catastrophic compounding error.

**Overall System Viability Gate:**

* **Success Threshold:** The benchmark must confirm the RB-005 estimate of a ![][image45] overall failure rate. An unanswerable rate of ![][image46] is considered highly acceptable for an enterprise-grade RAG system, provided that the Budget-Impossible Detection mechanism successfully identifies and flags ![][image47] of those unanswerable queries prior to generative execution, thereby preventing hallucinatory responses.

If these thresholds are achieved, the HCR architecture is definitively validated against its theoretical constraints. The hypotheses are proven, the targeted token efficiency is operationalized, and the project is cleared for Phase 2 production engineering.
