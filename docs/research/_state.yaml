# Current focus
current:
  phase: "research"  # discovery | research | implementation | validation
  focus: "H1 reframed into H1a/H1b/H1c (token efficiency, hybrid superiority, scoring lever). RB-003 scoring mechanics is next — gates H1c directly."
  blockers: []

# Research briefs status
briefs:
  active:
    - id: "RB-003"
      title: "Scoring mechanics"
      status: "prompt_ready"
      assigned_to: "JC (run across sources)"
      notes: "Prompt written. Covers: scoring landscape, admissibility, cross-level calibration, cascaded scoring, LATTICE analysis, information density, practical feasibility targets."
  completed:
    - id: "RB-001"
      title: "Prior art survey"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "12+ systems in the space since 2024. Hierarchical retrieval outperforms flat RAG on complex tasks (2-20pp gains). LATTICE is closest to HCR. No system targets hard token budgets. RAPTOR collapsed-tree result challenges strict top-down traversal."
    - id: "RB-002"
      title: "Theoretical basis: elimination vs similarity"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "Strict top-down elimination is theoretically fragile — error compounds as (1-ε)^d. RAPTOR collapsed-tree result is structurally predicted, not anomalous. Hybrid coarse-to-fine (shallow elimination + flat search within survivors) is theoretically optimal. H1 needs reframing from 'elimination > similarity' to 'hierarchical coarse-to-fine with token budgets > flat retrieval'."

# Hypothesis summary
hypotheses:
  total: 3
  validated: 0
  invalidated: 0
  uncertain: 3
  retired: 1  # Original H1
  highest_confidence: "H1b (hybrid coarse-to-fine superiority) at 75%"
  lowest_confidence: "H1a (token efficiency) at 65%"
  notes: "Original H1 retired and split into H1a (65%), H1b (75%), H1c (70%). Each independently testable. H1c (scoring lever) is the immediate research priority via RB-003."

# Next actions (prioritized)
next_actions:
  - "Scaffold and write RB-003 prompt (scoring mechanics — the exponential lever for H1c)"
  - "JC runs RB-003 prompt across sources"
  - "Consolidate RB-003 responses"
  - "Add Gemini response to RB-001/RB-002 if/when available"

# Notes for next session
notes: "H1 reframing complete. Original hypothesis retired, replaced by H1a (token efficiency, 65%), H1b (hybrid superiority, 75%), H1c (scoring lever, 70%). This is a refinement, not a pivot — core architecture remains valid. RB-003 is now the critical path: scoring feasibility gates H1c and informs the other two. Design implication locked in: beam width > tree depth, coarse routing + fine similarity."
