# Current focus
current:
  phase: "research"  # discovery | research | implementation | validation
  focus: "RB-002 consolidation complete. Theoretical findings challenge strict elimination — hybrid coarse-to-fine approach recommended. H1 reframing needed. RB-003 is next priority."
  blockers: []

# Research briefs status
briefs:
  active:
    - id: "RB-003"
      title: "Scoring mechanics"
      status: "pending"
      assigned_to: "unassigned"
      notes: "Elevated to highest priority by RB-002 findings. Per-level accuracy is the exponential lever in (1-ε)^d. Investigate admissible bounds, calibration, geometric scoring."
  completed:
    - id: "RB-001"
      title: "Prior art survey"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "12+ systems in the space since 2024. Hierarchical retrieval outperforms flat RAG on complex tasks (2-20pp gains). LATTICE is closest to HCR. No system targets hard token budgets. RAPTOR collapsed-tree result challenges strict top-down traversal."
    - id: "RB-002"
      title: "Theoretical basis: elimination vs similarity"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "Strict top-down elimination is theoretically fragile — error compounds as (1-ε)^d. RAPTOR collapsed-tree result is structurally predicted, not anomalous. Hybrid coarse-to-fine (shallow elimination + flat search within survivors) is theoretically optimal. H1 needs reframing from 'elimination > similarity' to 'hierarchical coarse-to-fine with token budgets > flat retrieval'."

# Hypothesis summary
hypotheses:
  total: 1
  validated: 0
  invalidated: 0
  uncertain: 1
  highest_confidence: "H1 at 55% (strict elimination) / 70% (hybrid coarse-to-fine reframing)"
  lowest_confidence: "H1 at 55%"
  notes: "RB-002 theoretical analysis weakens confidence in strict elimination but strengthens confidence in hybrid approach. H1 reframing recommended."

# Next actions (prioritized)
next_actions:
  - "Discuss H1 reframing with JC — 'hierarchical coarse-to-fine with hard token budgets' vs original 'elimination > similarity'"
  - "Scaffold and write RB-003 prompt (scoring mechanics — the exponential lever)"
  - "Update hypotheses.md with split confidence (strict elimination vs hybrid)"
  - "Add Gemini response to RB-001/RB-002 if/when available"

# Notes for next session
notes: "RB-002 consolidation is the most consequential finding so far. The theoretical consensus across 3 independent sources is unambiguous: strict elimination is fragile, hybrid coarse-to-fine is the theoretically grounded approach. This doesn't kill HCR — it sharpens it. HCR's differentiators (hierarchy for enrichment + coarse routing, hard token budget, external source pointers) remain valid and novel. But the retrieval strategy should be 'coarse elimination + fine similarity', not 'strict elimination top to bottom'. Key design implication: beam width > tree depth. Scoring quality has exponential returns via (1-ε)^d."
