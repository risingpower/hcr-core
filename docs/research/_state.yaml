      title: "Theoretical basis: elimination vs similarity"
      status: "created"
      assigned_to: "external"
      notes: "Prompt written. Awaiting source responses. Central question: under what conditions does strict top-down elimination outperform enriched flat retrieval?"
  completed:
    - id: "RB-001"
      title: "Prior art survey"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "12+ systems in the space since 2024. Hierarchical retrieval outperforms flat RAG on complex tasks (2-20pp gains). LATTICE is closest to HCR. No system targets hard token budgets. RAPTOR collapsed-tree result challenges strict top-down traversal."

# Next actions (prioritized)
next_actions:
  - "Scaffold and write RB-002 prompt (theoretical basis: elimination vs similarity)"
  - "Address RAPTOR collapsed-tree challenge directly in RB-002"
  - "Update hypotheses.md with H1 confidence at 65%"
  - "Add Gemini response to RB-001 if/when available"

# Notes for next session
notes: "RB-001 consolidation complete with 3/4 sources. Key finding: the RAPTOR collapsed-tree result is the strongest counter-evidence to HCR's strictly top-down design. RB-002 must directly address when elimination beats enriched flat retrieval. LATTICE (UT Austin) is the primary competitor — closest system to HCR's philosophy."
