      title: "Prior art survey"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "12+ systems in the space since 2024. Hierarchical retrieval outperforms flat RAG on complex tasks (2-20pp gains). LATTICE is closest to HCR. No system targets hard token budgets. RAPTOR collapsed-tree result challenges strict top-down traversal."
    - id: "RB-002"
      title: "Theoretical basis: elimination vs similarity"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "Strict top-down elimination is theoretically fragile — error compounds as (1-ε)^d. RAPTOR collapsed-tree result is structurally predicted, not anomalous. Hybrid coarse-to-fine (shallow elimination + flat search within survivors) is theoretically optimal. H1 needs reframing from 'elimination > similarity' to 'hierarchical coarse-to-fine with token budgets > flat retrieval'."
    - id: "RB-003"
      title: "Scoring mechanics"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "Cascade architecture (hybrid BM25+dense → cross-encoder) achieves ε ≈ 0.01–0.02 per level at ~40–80ms. Strict admissibility impossible for semantic relevance. Path-relevance EMA is higher leverage than per-node scoring. Summary quality is #1 upstream factor. AdaGReS submodular knapsack for token-budget selection. H1c → 75%."
    - id: "RB-004"
      title: "Tree construction"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "Four-source convergence on construction recipe: top-down divisive clustering (bisecting k-means, d=2–3, b∈[6,15]) + LLM contrastive routing summaries + soft assignment (1–3 parents per leaf). Routing summaries are a distinct artifact class: {theme, includes, excludes, key_entities, key_terms}. Gemini adds Q-STRUM Debate for adversarial contrastive generation, depth-variable summary formatting (contrastive prose at L1, keyword arrays + multi-vector at L2), Schema Entropy Bound and Sibling Distinctiveness (BM25 softmax) as concrete tree quality metrics, and EraRAG LSH hyperplanes as alternative partitioning with deterministic incremental maintenance. Cross-branch defense requires five layers. No routing-specific tree quality metric in literature — genuine research gap. H1b → 80%."
    - id: "RB-005"
      title: "Failure modes"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "No architectural showstopper. 26 failure modes identified across all pipeline stages. Overall expected failure rate: 10–20%. Top residual risks: (1) DPI information loss for detail queries, (2) budget impossibility for aggregation/listing queries, (3) beam collapse without diversity enforcement. Three design changes needed: beam diversity, collapsed-tree as co-primary, external source handling. Entity cross-links elevated to primary mechanism for dominant query type (entity-centric). Transition period (small corpus) is highest-risk deployment phase."
    - id: "RB-006"
      title: "Benchmark design"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "Four-source convergence on benchmark design. Hybrid corpus (50K–100K chunks from GitLab handbook + EnronQA + synthetic injectors). 300–400 stratified queries with budget-feasibility labels. 7 core metrics led by per-level routing accuracy ε (never measured in any system) and answer sufficiency under token constraint. 4 baselines (BM25, hybrid flat, flat+CE as kill baseline, RAPTOR). Fail-fast sequence with kill criteria at each step. MVB costs $15–30 in LLM API calls. Success criteria: HCR@400 ≥ flat@400 + 5pp, ε ≤ 0.03 per level, dual-path ≥ single-path + 3pp. Kill: flat+CE beats HCR at full corpus with significance."

# Next actions (prioritized)
next_actions:
  - "Analyse baselines per category — which query types does flat+CE handle well vs poorly? Are there categories where simpler baselines win?"
  - "Run HCR tree building on benchmark corpus: build tree, measure tree quality metrics (depth, branching factor, sibling distinctiveness)"
  - "Run HCR traversal (beam search + collapsed-tree dual-path) on the 50 queries"
  - "Compare HCR vs baselines — the kill criterion: does flat+CE beat HCR at full corpus with significance?"
  - "If HCR shows promise: expand corpus and scale up (fail-fast experiment 2)"
  - "Implement full mode with LLM sufficiency judge (run_benchmark.py --mode full)"

# Notes for next session
notes: |
  Session fixed a bug where IR metrics were computed on token-packed results (~1 chunk)
  instead of the full ranked list. After fix, baselines show credible numbers:
  - BM25: nDCG@10=0.705, Recall@10=0.82
  - Hybrid: nDCG@10=0.719, Recall@10=0.90
  - Flat+CE: nDCG@10=0.835, Recall@10=0.94 (kill baseline)

  Key observation: median chunk is 470 tokens, mean 398. At 400-token budget, packing
  yields 0-1 chunks. All baselines average 333-354 tokens. This is relevant for H1a
  (token efficiency) — there's not much room to compress further unless HCR can route
  to smaller, more targeted chunks.

  Flat+CE is strong. Cross-encoder reranking adds ~12pp nDCG over hybrid alone.
  HCR needs to beat 0.835 nDCG@10 under token constraints, or demonstrate value on
  specific query categories (cross-branch, multi-hop) where flat approaches struggle.
