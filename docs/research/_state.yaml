# Current focus
current:
  phase: "validation"  # discovery | research | implementation | validation
  focus: "Phase 1 core library complete (9 implementation phases). All components built and tested: types, corpus pipeline, indexes, LLM client, baselines, eval metrics, query suite, benchmark runner, HCR core (tree builder, traversal, dual-path). 126 tests passing, mypy/ruff clean. Now assembling corpus data and orchestration for empirical validation."

# Research briefs status
briefs:
  active: []
  completed:
    - id: "RB-001"
      title: "Prior art survey"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "12+ systems in the space since 2024. Hierarchical retrieval outperforms flat RAG on complex tasks (2-20pp gains). LATTICE is closest to HCR. No system targets hard token budgets. RAPTOR collapsed-tree result challenges strict top-down traversal."
    - id: "RB-002"
      title: "Theoretical basis: elimination vs similarity"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "Strict top-down elimination is theoretically fragile — error compounds as (1-ε)^d. RAPTOR collapsed-tree result is structurally predicted, not anomalous. Hybrid coarse-to-fine (shallow elimination + flat search within survivors) is theoretically optimal. H1 needs reframing from 'elimination > similarity' to 'hierarchical coarse-to-fine with token budgets > flat retrieval'."
    - id: "RB-003"
      title: "Scoring mechanics"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "Cascade architecture (hybrid BM25+dense → cross-encoder) achieves ε ≈ 0.01–0.02 per level at ~40–80ms. Strict admissibility impossible for semantic relevance. Path-relevance EMA is higher leverage than per-node scoring. Summary quality is #1 upstream factor. AdaGReS submodular knapsack for token-budget selection. H1c → 75%."
    - id: "RB-004"
      title: "Tree construction"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "Four-source convergence on construction recipe: top-down divisive clustering (bisecting k-means, d=2–3, b∈[6,15]) + LLM contrastive routing summaries + soft assignment (1–3 parents per leaf). Routing summaries are a distinct artifact class: {theme, includes, excludes, key_entities, key_terms}. Gemini adds Q-STRUM Debate for adversarial contrastive generation, depth-variable summary formatting (contrastive prose at L1, keyword arrays + multi-vector at L2), Schema Entropy Bound and Sibling Distinctiveness (BM25 softmax) as concrete tree quality metrics, and EraRAG LSH hyperplanes as alternative partitioning with deterministic incremental maintenance. Cross-branch defense requires five layers. No routing-specific tree quality metric in literature — genuine research gap. H1b → 80%."
    - id: "RB-005"
      title: "Failure modes"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "No architectural showstopper. 26 failure modes identified across all pipeline stages. Overall expected failure rate: 10–20%. Top residual risks: (1) DPI information loss for detail queries, (2) budget impossibility for aggregation/listing queries, (3) beam collapse without diversity enforcement. Three design changes needed: beam diversity, collapsed-tree as co-primary, external source handling. Entity cross-links elevated to primary mechanism for dominant query type (entity-centric). Transition period (small corpus) is highest-risk deployment phase."
    - id: "RB-006"
      title: "Benchmark design"
      completed: "2026-02-13"
      key_finding: "Four-source convergence on benchmark design. Hybrid corpus (50K–100K chunks from GitLab handbook + EnronQA + synthetic injectors). 300–400 stratified queries with budget-feasibility labels. 7 core metrics led by per-level routing accuracy ε (never measured in any system) and answer sufficiency under token constraint. 4 baselines (BM25, hybrid flat, flat+CE as kill baseline, RAPTOR). Fail-fast sequence with kill criteria at each step. MVB costs $15–30 in LLM API calls. Success criteria: HCR@400 ≥ flat@400 + 5pp, ε ≤ 0.03 per level, dual-path ≥ single-path + 3pp. Kill: flat+CE beats HCR at full corpus with significance."

# Next actions (prioritized)
next_actions:
  - "Build corpus download/preparation script (GitLab handbook)"
  - "Build CLI orchestration script for end-to-end benchmark runs"
  - "Generate query suite from corpus using LLM"
  - "Run fail-fast experiment 1: baseline sanity on small corpus"
  - "Run fail-fast experiment 2: flat+CE kill baseline at scale"
  - "Run fail-fast experiment 3: HCR vs baselines"

# Notes for next session
notes: "Phase 1 core library fully implemented across 9 phases (1,572 lines source, 2,455 lines tests). All components wired: tree construction, dual-path traversal, scoring cascades, benchmark infrastructure. Build is clean. Now need corpus data (GitLab handbook primary), query generation, and CLI orchestration to begin empirical validation. Starting with MVB approach: small corpus first to validate pipeline end-to-end, then scale."
