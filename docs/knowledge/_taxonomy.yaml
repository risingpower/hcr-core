# This file is the source of truth for the knowledge structure.
# Update this when adding patterns, contexts, domains, or edge cases.

# Pattern definitions (Level 1)
# Recurring phenomena that can be named, identified, and handled
patterns: {}
  # Example:
  # toggle:
  #   name: "Toggle Control"
  #   path: "patterns/toggle"
  #   identification:
  #     - "isCheckable == true"
  #     - "className contains 'Switch' or 'Toggle'"
  #   default_handling: "restore-state-after-interaction"
  #   variants:
  #     - id: "settings-toggle"
  #       distinguisher: "Located in preferences/settings screens"
  #     - id: "list-item-toggle"
  #       distinguisher: "Embedded within list items"
  #   reference_count: 0

# Context definitions (Level 3)
# Environmental factors that affect pattern behavior
contexts: {}
  # Example:
  # scrollable:
  #   name: "Scrollable Container"
  #   path: "contexts/scrollable"
  #   identification:
  #     - "isScrollable == true"
  #     - "className in ['RecyclerView', 'ScrollView', 'ListView']"
  #   affects_patterns:
  #     - "toggle"
  #     - "button"

# Domain definitions (Level 4)
# Platform/framework-specific constraints
domains: {}
  # Example:
  # compose:
  #   name: "Jetpack Compose"
  #   path: "domains/compose"
  #   identification:
  #     - "className contains 'ComposeView'"
  #   overrides_patterns:
  #     - "toggle"  # Compose toggles have different accessibility properties
